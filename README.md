# Scenario 1 (Bucket Sort)
### ```Sorting Papers```: 
- Sorting studentsâ€™ papers according to the ```alphabetical order``` of their ```first``` names. 
- This type of task is similar to the function of a sorting algorithm, like a ```bucket sort```. 
- By looking at only the first letter of the first name, you can remove a lot of unnecessary information. 
- This is an automated process that makes sorting more efficient.
